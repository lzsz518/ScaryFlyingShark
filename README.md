Careful you it will bite you in the dark

Scary flying shark
Careful you it will bite you in the dark
It swam in the sea long long ago
hit the bottom of the ship as it passed by pillow
it died suddenly and then became the ghost and
that's why it flies all over the town for children

Careful you it will bite you in the dark

Scary flying shark
Careful you it will bite you in the dark
Sometimes it even enters the chimney of you house
eats the little bugs inside and gobbles to house
just hope it does not find its way to you tiny bedroom
because there'll be no running and no escape and you
meet you doom
